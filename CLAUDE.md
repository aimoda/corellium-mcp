## Reference Repository

**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing any code, always search the `ref-repos/` directory first.

This directory contains reference implementations, examples, definitions, and documentation that should guide your implementation approach. Look for:

- Similar implementations and patterns
- API definitions and interfaces
- Code examples and usage patterns
- Architecture and design patterns
- Documentation and specifications

Use these references to ensure consistency with existing patterns and best practices before writing new code.

## Type Checking

**IMPORTANT**: After writing or modifying Python code, always run `pyright` to check for type errors and fix any issues found.
